                    <u>AR isnâ€™t designed for a professional or work environment.</u> <br /> <br />
                    Those who envision AR as involving a lot of hand-waving in the middle of a workplace environment have missed the point of AR. 
                    Because of its ability to integrate computer images with the real world, workplace apps are designed to facilitate information transfer, enhance productivity, and facilitate one-on-one collaborative communications

                <u>AR is only applicable for games and cool pictures.</u> <br /> <br />

                <u>AR is hard to use/make/expensive.</u> <br /> <br /> New platforms are allowing for the same templated, simplistic development for smart instruction AR tools. 
                This means, any organization can harness the power of AR through a simple drag-and-drop feature with no coding required.
